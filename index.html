            <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p>“Services” means the associated work and/or services relating to the customers’ requirements as stated in our proposal and/or quotation, or other agreed documentation.</p>
            <p>“Customer” refers to the individual and/or company who we are providing services to.</p>
            <p>“We”, “us”, “our” and “R.A.B Electrical” refer to R.A.B Electrical Ltd.</p>
            <p>“Goods” means the goods supplied and/or installed by R.A.B Electrical.</p>

            <h3>Incorporation of Conditions</h3>
            <p>All written and/or verbal agreements and/or contracts are subject to these standard Terms and Conditions. Any adjustments to our standard Terms and Conditions must be agreed in writing between the Customer and a Director of R.A.B Electrical.</p>

            <h3>Quotations and Pricing</h3>
            <p>All quotations provided will remain valid for 30 days from the date of issue. If quotations are not accepted within this timeframe, then adjustments to the pricing may be necessary. Any adjustments to quotations must be agreed between R.A.B Electrical and the customer prior to the commencement of works.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of the works carried out by R.A.B Electrical, we cannot guarantee additional work will not be required in order to fulfil the services agreed between us and the customer. In the event additional work is required which deviates from our quotation and/or agreed services, then this will be discussed with the customer immediately and agreed prior to the commencement of any additional works. The additional work will also be quoted wherever possible.</p>
            <p>All quotations and pricing given are based on the assumption that works can be carried out during our normal working hours (Monday – Friday 08:00am – 4:30pm) unless otherwise stated on the quotation and/or contract.</p>
            <p>If the customer gives a general instruction to carry out ‘repairs’ (without specifying a particular service or replacement parts) then R.A.B Electrical will carry out all repairs and/or modifications deemed necessary in order to fulfil the agreed services and/or contract, and ensure the customers equipment and/or property is left in good working order and compliant with current regulations.</p>
            <p>In the event overtime and/or out of hours work is required to fulfil our contractual obligations and/or meet any additional requirements from the customer, then this will be discussed and agreed with the customer prior to the commencement of works wherever reasonably practical. R.A.B Electrical also reserve the right to instruct our employees and/or subcontractors to work overtime and/or out of hours in the event of an emergency, or if the customers site and/or property would be deemed as unsafe or uncompliant if otherwise left. Any additional costs incurred from such overtime and/or out of hours work will be discussed with the customer as soon as possible and billed for accordingly.</p>
            
            <h3>Working on Site</h3>
            <p>It is assumed that R.A.B Electrical and any associated subcontractors will have free and safe access to the customers site during our normal working hours (Monday – Friday 08:00am – 4:30pm) unless otherwise stated on the quotation and/or contract. If access cannot be made during these hours then an amendment may be required to any quotations and/or contracts to include our out of hours working fees.</p>
            <p>During our work on site, we may also require additional facilities in order to carry out the services agreed – such as electricity and welfare facilities. Where applicable, the customer will comply with the latest Health & Safety at Work Legislation and ensure the site is safe and without risk to the Health and Safety of all persons who are working there. If additional facilities are not available as expected, then an amendment may be required to any quotations and/or contracts to include provision of these.</p>

            <h3>Payment</h3>
            <p>Unless otherwise agreed between R.A.B Electrical and the customer, then we will supply the customer with an invoice for the full amount agreed for the services upon completion of the works. All invoices are due for payment by the Due Date specified on the invoice, and all invoices will be issued in pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>All goods provided by R.A.B Electrical remain our property until full payment of any invoice(s) has been received.</p>
            <p>R.A.B Electrical reserves the right to charge statutory interest and charge debt recovery costs (where applicable) on any invoices which are not paid within the agreed timeframe as per late payment legislation. We also reserve the right to issue a Notice of Intent if appropriate, and pursue any unpaid invoices via the County Court.</p>

            <h3>Designs, Drawings and Specifications</h3>
            <p>The customer is responsible for the accuracy of any drawings, specifications and/or other data relating to the services which are provided to us and used in relation to the agreed work/quotation and/or contract.</p>
            <p>R.A.B Electrical will not be held liable to any third party which we may incur as a result of carrying out the services in accordance with the customers instruction and/or designs, drawings, specifications or other relevant documentation.</p>
            
            <h3>Warranty</h3>
            <p>R.A.B Electrical will take great care of customers equipment and property for the duration of our services, and will make good any loss and/or damage caused by our failure to do so. Any claims for damage/defective materials etc. must be notified to us in writing within 30 days of the completion of the work, including relevant pictures wherever possible.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise agreed, all goods and services provided by R.A.B Electrical come with a 12 month parts warranty. This does not include labour costs unless agreed between R.A.B Electrical and the customer in writing.</p>

            <h3>Termination of a Contract</h3>
            <p>R.A.B Electrical reserves the right to terminate any agreed contract immediately should the customer fail to comply with their obligations. We may also bring any contracts to an end should a customer become bankrupt, insolvent or enter into any scheme or arrangement with creditors.</p>
            <p>Should a contract be terminated, the customer will remain liable to R.A.B Electrical for any sums which have not yet been settled – for all work/services up to the date of the termination.</p>

            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>R.A.B Electrical will not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations set out in any agreements and/or contracts whereby the failure results from any cause outside of our reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to natural occurrences, disruption of power supplies etc.</p>
